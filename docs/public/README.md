## What It's Not

- Not a CMS
- Not a platform
- Not an editor
- Not blockchain-based
- Not VC-fundable

## Why

Platforms are failing creators. Algorithms are eating culture. The web is recentralizing.

But the technology is ready. Rust is fast. WASM is portable. IndieWeb protocols work.

Time for infrastructure that does almost nothing, beautifully.

## License

MIT. Take it. Fork it. Make it yours.
