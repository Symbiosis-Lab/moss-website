### Exclusion Criteria
- Blockchain/crypto-focused grants
- Accelerators wanting equity or architectural compromise
- Grants requiring tech stack changes or focus redirection
- Emergency/rapid response funds (not infrastructure-focused)

## Revenue Strategy

- Open Collective donations
- GitHub Sponsors
- Target: $1K/month

### Phase 2: Initial Revenue (Year 2)

- moss.host hosting: $9-29/month
- Target: 100 paying users = $2K/month

- Plugin marketplace: 30% revenue share
- Target: $10K/month = self-sustaining

## Risk Management

### Financial Independence Principles
- Never hire based on grant promises - revenue first
- No single funder >30% of budget
- Build revenue from day one, grants accelerate

### Success Indicators
- Grant success rate >30% 
- Revenue growing faster than grants
- Multiple funding sources with clear sustainability path

### Warning Signs to Avoid
- Changing roadmap for grant requirements
- Grants becoming >50% of budget
- Applying to misaligned opportunities

## Long-term Vision

**By Year 3:** Grants <20% of budget, revenue covers operations, grants only for expansion
