## Year 3 Vision

### Sustainable Operations

- 6 months runway buffer

## Financial Principles

### Spending Philosophy
- **Default alive** - Always have 6+ months runway
- **Revenue before hiring** - Don't hire on grant promises
- **Frugal operations** - Every dollar matters

### Revenue Priorities
1. **Recurring revenue** (subscriptions)
2. **Service revenue** (support contracts)
3. **One-time revenue** (setup fees)
4. **Grant revenue** (temporary boost)

### Cost Structure
- **People**: 60-70% (keep lean)
- **Infrastructure**: 10-15%
- **Marketing/Content**: 10-15%
- **Buffer**: 10-15%

## Pricing Strategy

### moss.pub Hosting
- **Hobby**: $0 (limited features)
- **Creator**: $9/month (custom domain)
- **Pro**: $29/month (analytics, priority)
- **Enterprise**: Custom

### Why This Works
- Below Substack ($50+/month)
- Above Ghost starter ($9)
- Simple tiers
- Clear value progression

## Key Financial Metrics

### Health Indicators
- Months of runway
- Revenue growth rate
- Customer acquisition cost
- Customer lifetime value
- Churn rate

### Danger Signals
- Runway <6 months
- Revenue flat for 3 months
- CAC > LTV
- Churn >10% monthly

## Exit Strategy

**We don't have one.**

This is not a startup. We're building infrastructure. Success means:
- Sustainable operations
- Community ownership
- Decades of operation
- Gradual evolution

If crisis hits:
- Open source everything
- Transfer to foundation
- Community takes over
- Infrastructure persists
