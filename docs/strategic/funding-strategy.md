# moss Funding Strategy

> Grants as validation and acceleration, not survival

## Funding Philosophy

- Apply only when we have proof, not promises
- Target funders who share our values
- Each grant builds credibility for the next
- Revenue replaces grants over time

## Grant Application Principles

### What Makes a Strong Application

**Have first:**
- Working software
- Active users (50+ minimum)
- Clear differentiation
- Community forming
- 6-month roadmap

**Frame as:**
- Acceleration, not survival
- Already growing, funding speeds it up
- Specific deliverables funding enables

**Emphasize:**
- Local-first philosophy
- User ownership
- Federation/protocols
- Ecosystem thinking

### What We DON'T Apply For

- Blockchain/crypto grants
- Grants requiring specific tech stacks
- Accelerators wanting equity
- Anything requiring architectural compromise
- Grants that would redirect focus

## Revenue Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation (Months 6-12)
- Open Collective donations
- GitHub Sponsors
- Target: $1K/month

### Phase 2: Initial Revenue (Year 2)
- moss.pub hosting: $9-29/month
- Target: 100 paying users = $2K/month

### Phase 3: Sustainability (Year 2+)
- Enterprise support: $5K/month contracts
- Plugin marketplace: 30% revenue share
- Target: $10K/month = self-sustaining

## Funding Risk Mitigation

### Avoid Grant Dependence
- Never hire based on grant promises
- Keep burn rate minimal
- Build revenue from day one

### Maintain Independence
- No single funder >30% of budget
- Clear "no" to misaligned opportunities
- Document why we declined

### Portfolio Approach
- Technical grants (Mozilla, NLnet)
- Cultural grants (Knight, Arts)
- Small experiments (Awesome)
- Community funding (Open Collective)

## Success Metrics

### Healthy Funding
- Grant success rate >30%
- Revenue growing faster than grants
- Multiple funding sources
- Clear path to sustainability

### Warning Signs
- Applying to grants we don't believe in
- Changing roadmap for grant requirements
- Grants becoming >50% of budget
- Panic applications

## The End Game

By Year 3:
- Grants <20% of budget
- Revenue covers operations
- Grants only for expansion
- Can say no to any funder
