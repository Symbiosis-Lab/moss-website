# Moss Growth Strategy

> No growth hacking. No viral loops. Just steady value creation.

## Growth Philosophy

We grow like moss - slowly, inevitably, in overlooked spaces. We don't optimize for metrics. We optimize for creators who need what we build.

## User Acquisition Phases

### Phase 0: Personal Network (Months 1-3)
**Target: 20 users**

- Former Matters users who trust me
- Writer friends in NYC  
- Chinese writing community
- People who already know the problem

**Channels:**
- Direct messages
- Personal conversations
- No public marketing

### Phase 1: Community Infiltration (Months 4-6)
**Target: 100 users**

- IndieWeb community (philosophical alignment)
- Digital gardeners (tool alignment)
- Static site generator refugees (pain alignment)
- Frustrated Substack writers (platform fatigue)

**Channels:**
- Community forums (not promoting, helping)
- Webring participation
- Development logs
- Word of mouth only

### Phase 2: Cultural Moments (Months 7-9)
**Target: 500 users**

- First NYC content campaign
- Creates reason to try Moss
- Press coverage from campaign
- Participants become users

**Channels:**
- Campaign participants
- Local press coverage
- Social media organic
- Community referrals

### Phase 3: Network Effects (Months 10-12)
**Target: 1000+ users**

- Users recruit users
- Plugin developers bring communities
- Federated content creates connections
- Ecosystem becomes self-reinforcing

**Channels:**
- User referrals
- Plugin marketplaces
- Federation discovery
- Organic search

## Content Strategy

### Core Principles
- **Find what NYC hides** - The stories everyone has but doesn't share
- **Create cathartic release** - Permission to be vulnerable
- **Test with micro-experiments** - $500 tests before $5K campaigns
- **Physical + digital** - NYC craves real-world connection

### Research Methodology
- Monitor NYC digital spaces for emotional flashpoints
- Track what NYC residents hide vs. what they share
- Identify taboos that everyone experiences
- Test resonance with micro-experiments

### Campaign Principles
- **Tap into what people already have** (stories, texts, confessions)
- **Break NYC taboos** (money, failure, leaving)
- **Create cathartic release** (shared shame becomes connection)
- **Leverage NYC's specific anxieties** (success theater, loneliness, cost)

### Execution Ladder
1. **Micro-experiments** ($500-2K) - Test emotional resonance
2. **Viral moments** ($5-10K) - Create cultural flashpoints
3. **Sustained campaigns** ($20K+) - Build recurring anticipation
4. **Cultural institutions** ($100K+) - Become part of NYC fabric

## Retention Strategy

### Daily Value
- Must improve creator's existing workflow
- Not add new work

### Zero Friction  
- Nothing to learn
- Nothing to maintain
- Nothing to manage

### Community Connection
- Connect creators to readers
- Connect creators to each other
- Make creation less lonely

### Progressive Power
- Basic users stay basic
- Power users can grow
- Plugins enable evolution

## Success Metrics

### Vanity Metrics We Ignore
- Total signups
- Page views
- Social media followers
- Press mentions

### Real Metrics We Track
- **Weekly Active Creators** (publishing, not just visiting)
- **Posts per creator per month** (>4 shows habit)
- **Month 3 retention** (>40% shows value)
- **Creator-to-creator referrals** (organic growth)
- **Time to first publish** (<5 minutes)

### Ecosystem Health
- Community plugins created
- Sites linking to each other
- Submissions between sites
- Self-hosted instances

## Anti-Growth Strategies

Things we explicitly DON'T do:

- No product hunt launches
- No growth hacking tactics
- No paid advertising
- No influencer marketing
- No referral programs
- No gamification
- No FOMO creation
- No artificial scarcity

## Community Building

### Principles
- **Builders over users** - Attract people who create
- **Quality over quantity** - 100 passionate > 10,000 passive
- **Contribution over consumption** - Everyone can add value

### Spaces
- GitHub Discussions (primary)
- Discord/Matrix (real-time help)
- No Slack (too closed)
- No Facebook (wrong values)

### Rituals
- Weekly development logs
- Monthly community calls
- Quarterly virtual meetups
- Annual NYC gathering
