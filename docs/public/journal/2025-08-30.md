# Documentation as Product

Today we reorganized our documentation structure, discovering principles that apply far beyond file organization.

## The Problem

Documentation had grown organically across two main directories (`docs/developer/` and `docs/strategic/`) with overlapping content, mixed audiences, and no clear separation between public-facing and internal materials. We needed to prepare for dogfooding - using moss itself to publish our documentation as a website.

This created a concrete constraint: what should be public vs internal? How do we minimize cognitive load for different audiences?

## The Discovery

**Documentation is a product.** It needs user experience design, information architecture, and clear purpose separation.

The breakthrough came from recognizing we serve distinct audiences:

- **Public users**: Want to understand what moss is and how it works
- **Contributors**: Need technical details and implementation guidance
- **Team members**: Require strategic planning and detailed specifications

## The Solution

### New Structure

```
docs/
├── public/          # Website content (moss compiles these)
├── internal/        # GitHub-visible team reference
└── README.md        # Navigation guide
```

### Content Strategy Principles

1. **Single source of truth** - No duplicated concepts across files
2. **Audience-first organization** - Structure follows user needs, not internal logic
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Public docs link to internal details when needed
4. **Dogfooding readiness** - Public directory becomes the actual website

## Key Insights

### Documentation Fragmentation Kills Clarity

We found the same philosophical concepts scattered across three different files. Each repetition introduced slight variations, creating confusion rather than reinforcement.

**Solution**: Consolidate related concepts in single, authoritative documents. Link rather than duplicate.

### Separate "What/Why" from "How"

Public documentation should answer "What does this do?" and "Why would I want it?" Internal documentation handles "How do I implement it?"

**Example**: POSSE strategy explanation belongs in public philosophy. POSSE plugin implementation details belong in internal technical docs.

### File Structure Shapes Thinking

When documentation structure mirrors organizational thinking rather than user needs, it becomes a maze for outsiders.

**Learning**: Start with the user's journey, then organize content to support that path.

### The Dogfooding Test

Preparing to use moss for our own documentation revealed every structural weakness. If we can't navigate our own docs easily, neither can users.

**Insight**: Tools that don't solve their creator's problems rarely solve anyone else's.

## What This Means for moss

This reorganization validates moss's core value proposition: **turning folder structure into user experience**. The challenge wasn't writing content - it was organizing it for different audiences with minimal cognitive overhead.

moss handles exactly this complexity: taking however users organize their content and making it accessible to readers.

## Technical Notes

- Eliminated content duplication across philosophy, architecture, and strategy documents
- Created clear separation between user-facing (`public/`) and contributor-focused (`internal/`) content
- Moved all journals to `public/` for development transparency
- Established README.md as navigation hub following GitHub conventions
- Ready for moss dogfooding with `public/` as source directory
