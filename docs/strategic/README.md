# moss Strategic Overview

> Building slowly, growing inevitably

## Core Strategy

**Build first, fund second.** We have runway to build without compromise. Grants become tools for validation and community access, not survival. Content initiatives demonstrate value without changing architecture. Growth comes from creating cultural moments, not marketing campaigns.

## The Plan

### Year 1: Foundation

**Months 1-6:** Build core moss, reach 100 users  
**Months 7-12:** Launch ecosystem, reach 1000 users

### Year 2: Growth

Scale to sustainable revenue, reduce grant dependence

### Year 3: Ecosystem

Self-sustaining infrastructure for the open web

## Principles We Hold

1. **Local-first always** - Users own their data
2. **Standards over invention** - Use existing protocols
3. **Invisible infrastructure** - Should barely exist
4. **Patient growth** - No growth hacking
5. **Community ownership** - This belongs to everyone

## What We're Building

Not a startup. Not a platform. Not an exit.

We're building infrastructure for the next generation of the web. Where creators own their work, readers find genuine voices, and the web becomes interesting again.

One folder at a time. One site at a time. One creator at a time.

Until the whole forest is green.
