```

## âœ… Automatic Finder Integration (macOS)

The Quick Action is now **automatically installed** when Moss first launches:

1. **Automatic Installation:** First time the app starts, it creates:
   - `~/Library/Services/Publish to Web.workflow` bundle
   - Proper Info.plist with bundle identifier
   - Complete Automator workflow with shell script action
   
2. **Zero Configuration:** No manual setup required

**Usage:** Right-click any folder in Finder â†’ "Publish to Web" (appears directly in context menu)

The workflow calls `moss://publish?path=/encoded/folder/path` which triggers site generation.

## Key Implementation Insights & Learnings

### macOS Finder Integration Challenges Solved

**Context Menu Placement:**
- Automator Quick Actions with `NSIconName` property force items into "Quick Actions" submenu
- **Solution:** Remove `NSIconName` from Info.plist and use proper `NSServices` configuration
- **Result:** "Publish to Web" appears at top level like Google Drive's context menu items

**Deep Link Protocol Requirements:**
- macOS deep links only work in built/installed apps, not during `tauri dev`
- **Critical:** Must test with `npm run tauri build` and install in `/Applications`
- Deep link protocol registration requires specific plugin configuration in `tauri.conf.json`

**Bundle Identifier Best Practices:**
- Never end with `.app` (conflicts with macOS app bundle extension)
- Use reverse domain notation: `com.moss.publisher` (not `com.moss.app`)
- Workflow bundle identifiers should match: `com.moss.publisher.publish-to-web`

**Icon Generation Issues:**
- Tauri template sometimes ships with corrupted/empty `.icns` files
- **Solution:** Always regenerate icons using `npx @tauri-apps/cli icon src-tauri/icons/icon.png`
- Clean `src-tauri/target/` directory after icon regeneration to force refresh

### Tauri-Specific Development Patterns

**Menu Bar App Architecture:**
- Set `ActivationPolicy::Accessory` on macOS to prevent dock icon
- Intercept window close events to hide (not quit) the app
- Essential for menu bar utilities that should persist in background

**Testing Strategy:**
- Backend tests for pure logic (Rust functions)
- Integration tests for mocked frontend-backend communication
- Manual testing required for OS-level integrations (context menus, deep links)

**File System Operations:**
- Always use absolute paths in Tauri commands
- Create directories recursively with `fs::create_dir_all`
- Clean up existing files before installation to ensure fresh state
- Use `std::env::var("HOME")` for cross-user compatibility in macOS paths

**Workflow Bundle Creation:**
- `.workflow` files are actually bundles (directories) with `Contents/` subdirectory
- Require both `Info.plist` (bundle metadata) and `document.wflow` (workflow definition)
- Must include proper `NSServices` array in Info.plist for Services menu integration
- Shell script actions need specific parameter structure and UUIDs for Automator compatibility

### User Experience Insights

**Zero-Configuration Philosophy:**
- Manual setup steps are unacceptable UX for consumer tools
- Automatic installation must happen transparently on first launch
- Users expect behavior similar to Google Drive, Dropbox (top-level context menu)

**Error Communication:**
- Focus on user-observable behaviors when describing testing steps
- Avoid implementation details in user-facing messaging
- Always provide clear "what should happen" expectations

**Development Workflow Best Practices:**
- Never commit partial implementations - only complete, testable features
- Manual verification required before committing OS integration features
- Amend commits to include documentation updates rather than separate commits
- Build and test the complete user journey, not just individual components
- **Implementation optimizations are not commits** - refactoring, dependency removal, code cleanup
- Only commit when adding/fixing user-facing functionality or fixing bugs

**Dependency Management Philosophy:**
- **Avoid external dependencies when possible** - especially for simple operations
- **Consider bundle size impact** - every dependency increases distribution size
- **Prefer native solutions** - shell commands over Python/Node.js for simple tasks
- **Self-contained is better** - reduce failure points and system requirements
- Example: Use `sed 's/ /%20/g'` instead of `python3 urllib.parse` for URL encoding

### Code Organization Balance

**Avoiding Over-Engineering at Early Stage:**
- **1,300+ line single file** signals need for organization, but **10+ micro-files** creates cognitive overhead
- **3-file split** matches natural boundaries: app setup (`main.rs`), data types (`types.rs`), business logic (`commands.rs`)
- **Self-explanatory names** eliminate need for documentation about file purposes
- **Tests with implementation** - move orphaned test files back to code they test
- **Room to grow** - each file can expand to 300-400 lines before next split decision

**Decision Framework:**
- Split when navigation becomes difficult, not at arbitrary line counts
- Respect project stage - MVP needs different organization than mature codebase
- Follow existing patterns and conventions over abstract principles
- Optimize for current team size and development velocity

### System Tray Visibility Detection

**macOS Menu Bar Limitations:**
- When too many icons exist, macOS de-prioritizes less important items
- Icons can be "added" but become invisible (hidden off-screen)
- No official NSStatusItem API to detect this hidden state

**Three-State Detection System:**
- `NotAdded`: Tray icon creation failed completely
- `AddedButHidden`: Icon exists but is hidden due to space constraints  
- `Visible`: Icon is actually visible in menu bar

**Implementation Approach:**
- Basic detection: Check if `app.tray_by_id()` returns valid handle
- Advanced detection requires macOS accessibility APIs (`AXUIElementCopyElementAtPosition`)
- Full implementation needs position detection and bundle ID matching
- **Critical insight**: Focus on detection, not workarounds (changing icons, warnings)

**User Experience Philosophy:**
- "Find the logically shortest path" - detect and fix priority, don't work around
- Avoid UI band-aids when the real issue is system-level integration
- Users expect system-level problems to have system-level solutions

### API Design Evolution

**Simplicity Principle: "Simple to Complex, Never Reverse"**
- Start with minimal viable API surface area
- Refactored from 4 functions to 3 essential commands:
  - `publish_folder` - Core functionality
  - `install_finder_integration` - OS integration  
  - `get_system_status` - Diagnostic information
- Only add complexity when proven necessary through real usage

**Testing Strategy Refinement:**
- Remove duplicate test files that serve same purpose
- Keep file structure compact and self-explanatory
- Consolidate redundant functionality rather than maintaining parallel implementations
- Example: Removed `test-status.html` and `test-tray.js` as they duplicated main app functionality

### Future Development Considerations

**Static Site Generation Next:**
- Folder scanning with `walkdir` crate
- Markdown processing with `pulldown-cmark`
- Template system with `tera` engine
- Asset optimization pipeline

**Cross-Platform Context Menus:**
- Windows: Shell extensions (more complex than macOS)
- Linux: File manager specific (Nautilus, Dolphin, etc.)
- Each platform requires different integration approach

**URL Encoding & Path Handling:**
- Folder paths with spaces require URL encoding in deep link URLs
- Use native shell encoding: `printf '%s\n' "$path" | sed 's/ /%20/g'` (no Python dependency)
- Decode with `decodeURIComponent()` in JavaScript before passing to Rust backend
- Always validate paths are non-empty before processing
- Avoid external dependencies like Python for simple operations
