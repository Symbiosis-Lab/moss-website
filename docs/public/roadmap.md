## Technical Principles

1. **Plugin-first architecture** - Core stays minimal (~5MB), unlimited extensibility via plugins
2. **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box, plugins auto-install when needed
3. **Progressive enhancement** - Start with minimal SSG, add plugins as requirements grow
4. **Local-first always** - Network optional, plugins run locally
5. **Standards over invention** - Use existing protocols, orchestrate existing tools
6. **Process isolation** - Plugins run in sandboxed subprocesses for security and stability
