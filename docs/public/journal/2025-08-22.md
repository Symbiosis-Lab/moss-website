# August 22, 2025 - The First Website

The first transformation worked today. A folder became a website.

## The Goal

We started with the simplest possible test case: three markdown files in `test-content/simple-blog/`. Transform them into browsable HTML, serve locally, open automatically in the browser.

## The Pipeline

The workflow came together quickly:
1. Scan directory for markdown files
2. Parse with pulldown-cmark (fast, spec-compliant)  
3. Generate HTML with minimal styling
4. Serve via embedded Axum server
5. Open in default browser

## Key Decision: Real HTTP Server

We could have used file:// URLs, but that felt wrong. CORS restrictions would break things. Relative paths wouldn't work. The preview wouldn't match deployment behavior.

Axum gave us a real HTTP server in about 50 lines of Rust. Now the preview behaves exactly like the deployed site. No surprises.

## The Moment

When the browser opened showing the transformed blog - markdown rendered as clean HTML, navigation working, images loading - it felt like the first real proof that moss could work.

Not just the technical proof. The *experience* proof. A human writes markdown files in folders they understand. moss turns that into a website they can share. Simple transformation, profound capability.

## What We Built

- Content scanning that finds markdown files
- Fast, correct markdown parsing  
- HTML generation with sensible defaults
- Local HTTP server with automatic port detection
- Cross-platform browser opening

Tomorrow we make it accessible from Finder. But today we proved the core concept: folders can become websites.
