# Documentation as Product Design

## The Problem

Documentation had grown across two main directories (`docs/developer/` and `docs/strategic/`) with overlapping content, mixed audiences, and no clear separation between public and internal materials.

We needed to prepare for dogfooding—using moss itself to publish our documentation as a website. This forced a key question: what should be public versus internal?

## The Insight

**Documentation is a product.** It needs user experience design, information architecture, and clear purpose separation.

The breakthrough came from recognizing distinct audiences:

- **Public users**: Want to understand what moss is and how it works
- **Contributors**: Need technical details and implementation guidance  
- **Team members**: Require strategic context and detailed specifications

Three different audiences with different needs, all trying to use the same confused documentation structure.

## The Solution

### New Structure
```
docs/
├── public/          # Website content (moss compiles these)
├── internal/        # GitHub-visible team reference
└── README.md        # Navigation guide
```

Simple structure with clear purpose separation.

### Content Strategy Principles

**Single Source of Truth**: No duplicated concepts across files. Repetition creates inconsistency.

**Audience-First Organization**: Structure follows user needs, not internal convenience.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Public docs link to internal details when readers need more depth.

**Dogfooding Readiness**: Public directory becomes the actual website content.

## The Fragmentation Problem

Investigation revealed the same concepts scattered across three different files. Each repetition had slight variations—not intentional evolution but accidental drift.

Philosophy repeated without purpose becomes philosophy diluted. Core insights lose power through mindless repetition.

## Information Architecture Principles

The restructuring connected to moss philosophy: just as moss provides "infrastructure that does almost nothing beautifully," documentation structure should make finding information feel natural.

Good information architecture disappears. Users find what they need without conscious awareness of organization. When navigation becomes invisible, content can do its job.

## The Meta-Principle

When documentation feels hard to navigate, the problem usually isn't writing quality—it's information architecture. Fix the structure first, then improve the content.

Structure shapes thought. Poor organization creates cognitive load that good writing can't overcome. Clear organization makes mediocre content usable; confused organization makes great content inaccessible.

## Implementation Impact

**Clear audience separation** reduces cognitive load for each reader type

**Dogfooding** validates our publishing pipeline through real usage

**Single source of truth** prevents concept drift across documents

**Progressive disclosure** serves beginners and experts without compromise

This transforms documentation from overhead into strategic asset that grows with the product.

## The Universal Truth

Good information architecture feels inevitable. Users find what they need without marveling at the organization.

When readers focus on content rather than navigation, the architecture succeeds. When they struggle to find information, the architecture fails regardless of content quality.

Documentation as product design. Information as user experience. Structure as philosophy in action.
