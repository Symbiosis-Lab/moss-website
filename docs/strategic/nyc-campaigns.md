# NYC Campaign Brainstorm

> Finding what NYC hides but everyone experiences

## The NYC Insight

NYC isn't just exhausted - it's lonely. In a city of 8 million, we're all performing success while privately struggling. The campaign that wins won't just go viral - it will make people feel less alone.

## Campaigns with Heart

### "The Weight We Carry"
**The Heart:** Every New Yorker carries invisible weight - immigrant parents' dreams, career pressures, rent burden, loneliness. We all carry something heavy through these streets.

**The Mechanism:**
- People share what weight they carry
- Others respond: "I carry that too" or "Let me help carry that"
- Creates chains of solidarity

**Why It Builds Belonging:**
- Recognizes shared struggle without exploitation
- Creates empathy across difference  
- Builds solidarity, not competition
- "We're all carrying something" becomes communal recognition

### "Letters to Strangers on the Subway"
**The Heart:** Write to someone you see but never speak to - your morning commute regular, the bodega cat lady, the chess player in the park.

**Why It Connects:**
- Celebrates silent relationships
- Makes the invisible visible
- Creates recognition: "Someone sees me"
- Reveals the intimacy of shared routine

### "NYC Inheritance"
**The Heart:** What did NYC give you that you'll carry forever? What are you leaving for the next person?

**The Format:** Two parts - what you inherited from the city, what you're passing on.

**Why It Unites:**
- Links generations of New Yorkers
- Creates continuity beyond individual stories
- Builds legacy thinking
- "We're all temporary guardians"

### "The Day NYC Saved Me"
**The Heart:** When the city or its people unexpectedly came through - the stranger who helped, the moment that kept you going.

**Why It Matters:**
- Reveals hidden kindness
- Creates gratitude practice
- Shows we save each other
- Counters cynicism with earned hope

### "Midnight Confessions"
**The Heart:** What you think about at 3am in NYC - the fears, dreams, and questions that keep you awake.

**Why It Resonates:**
- Universal insomnia experience
- Vulnerable without being performative
- Creates "we're all awake together" feeling
- Night thoughts are most honest

## Edgier Concepts (Higher Risk/Reward)

### "Drunk Texts to Exes (NYC Edition)"
- Real drunk texts sent/received
- Context provided
- Equal parts cringe and cathartic
- Would definitely go viral
- Might be too chaotic

### "NYC Therapy Sessions"
- Anonymous therapy revelations
- What NYC really talks about in therapy
- Deeply vulnerable
- Potential ethical issues

### "Roommate Horror Stories"
- Name and shame bad roommates
- Screenshots of insane requests
- Everyone has one
- Legal considerations needed

- No "grit and hustle" porn (exhausting)
- No "authentic NYC" gatekeeping (divisive)

## Selection Criteria

The winning campaign must:
1. **Tap into hidden universal experience**
2. **Give permission for vulnerability**
3. **Create cathartic release**
4. **Have viral mechanics built in**
5. **Connect to moss naturally** (people need sites for their stories)

## Next Steps
