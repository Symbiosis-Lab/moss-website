# The Orchestration Insight

## The Problem

Building a template and theme system for moss felt overwhelming. Should we create our own template language? Reimplement Jekyll's object model in Rust? Build yet another static site generator?

Each path required months of work to recreate what already existed. More importantly, we were planning to **compete** with tools that users already loved.

Users want access to existing themes. Jekyll has 300+ options. Hugo has fast, well-designed themes. But using them requires learning new workflows, folder structures, and configuration systems—barriers that discourage experimentation.

## The Research Phase

We researched liquid-rust compatibility, theme ecosystem sizes, Jekyll versus Hugo architectures. Our plan was to reimplement Jekyll's template engine for theme compatibility.

The plan was logical and thorough. Also completely wrong.

Something bothered us during research: we were planning to spend months recreating what Jekyll already does well. The inefficiency was obvious once we saw it.

## The Core Insight

**moss shouldn't compete with SSGs—it should complete them.**

This insight changed our entire approach:

- Don't reimplement Jekyll; orchestrate it
- Don't recreate themes; enable existing ones  
- Don't force folder structures; adapt any structure to tool requirements

The user journey becomes: See a beautiful Jekyll theme → moss downloads Jekyll automatically → your content + chosen theme = published website.

No new learning required.

## Technical Implementation

Two key innovations emerged:

### Virtual Filesystem Adaptation

User files stay exactly where they are. moss creates a temporary SSG-compatible structure in `.moss/build/` using symlinks, runs the SSG against it, then cleans up. Users never see the translation layer.

This preserves user folder organization while satisfying tool requirements.

### Post-Build Social Layer

Instead of building social features into our SSG, we inject Lichen.js into final HTML output. This approach works with any SSG—Jekyll, Hugo, Zola, or our minimal engine.

Universal compatibility through post-processing.

## Why This Approach Works

This architecture transforms moss from ecosystem competitor to **ecosystem enabler**:

**Theme Access**: 1000+ themes across all major SSGs become available  
**Zero Learning Curve**: Users keep their folder structures and workflows  
**Progressive Enhancement**: Start with minimal SSG, upgrade to full ecosystems when needed  
**Universal Features**: Social and publishing layers work with any generated site  
**Ecosystem Growth**: We strengthen existing tools rather than fragment the market

## The Homebrew Pattern

We realized we're not building another package—we're building the **package manager for static sites**.

Homebrew's value isn't in the packages themselves but in making complex installations simple. Users run `brew install postgresql` without mastering PostgreSQL compilation.

moss follows the same pattern: Users choose Jekyll themes without mastering Jekyll workflows. We handle the complexity; they focus on content.

## Implementation Strategy

**Virtual Structure Mapping**: Adapt user folder organization to any SSG's requirements  
**Plugin-Based Integration**: Each SSG becomes a downloadable capability  
**Post-Build Enhancement**: Add features via HTML injection after SSG completion  
**Theme-Driven Selection**: Visual choice drives technical implementation

This turns moss from another tool into ecosystem orchestration infrastructure.

## The Philosophical Shift

We're not building another static site generator. We're building the **orchestration layer** the ecosystem was missing—infrastructure that connects human creativity with tool capability.

The best infrastructure feels inevitable rather than innovative. Users shouldn't marvel at our cleverness; they should focus on their content while we handle everything else.

This is how moss grows—not by replacing the forest but by creating conditions for the whole ecosystem to thrive.
