## Philosophy

Like its namesake, moss thrives in the spaces others overlook. It doesn't compete with platforms for sunlight. It creates the foundation layer that enables an entire ecosystem.

- **Invisible but essential** - You don't notice moss until it's gone
- **Resilient** - Survives where others can't
- **Reproductive** - Spreads through reproduction, not control
- **Transformative** - Breaks down inorganic matter into organic matter
- **Symbiotic** - Creates conditions for other life to flourish
- **Patient** - Grows slowly but persistently

## Principles

- No database
- No server required
- No platform lock-in
- No new protocols
- Everything is a plugin

# The moss Philosophy

## Core Beliefs

**Local-first always** - Users own their data. Files on disk, under user control, never held hostage by servers.

**Standards over invention** - The web works. RSS works. HTML works. We don't need new protocols. We need better tools for existing ones.

**Invisible infrastructure** - The best tools disappear. moss should feel like magic: right-click folder, website appears. No configuration, no learning curve.

**Patient growth** - Grow like nature - slowly, inevitably, in overlooked spaces. No growth hacking. No viral loops. Just steady value creation.

**Community ownership** - This belongs to everyone. Open source, open protocols, open future.

## Design Principles

### No Database

Every piece of content is a file. Your writing isn't trapped in binary blobs or SQL tables. It's just files, portable forever.

### No Server Required

Static sites are resilient. They survive platform shutdowns, company acquisitions, and infrastructure failures. A folder of HTML files will outlive any platform.

### No Platform Lock-in

Your content, your domain, your audience. moss is infrastructure, not a platform. When you outgrow moss, take your files and leave. No export process needed.

### Minimal New Protocols

We use what already works: HTTP, RSS, ActivityPub, WebMentions. The web has enough protocols. We just need to use them better.

### Everything is a Plugin

The core does one thing: transform folders to websites. Everything else - themes, syndication, analytics - is a plugin. Start simple, grow as needed.

## Human-Computer Symbiosis

moss emerges from Symbiosis Lab's exploration of human-information system coevolution. We believe infrastructure should:

- **Amplify** human creativity, not constrain it
- **Disappear** when not needed, appear when required
- **Adapt** to human workflows, not force new ones
- **Preserve** human agency while providing machine efficiency

The best tools might feel inevitable, not innovative.

## What We're Building

Not a startup. Not a platform. Not an exit.

We're building infrastructure for the next generation of the web. Where creators own their work, readers find genuine voices, and the web becomes interesting again.

One folder at a time. One site at a time. One creator at a time.

Until the whole forest is green.
