# August 23, 2025 - Testing What Matters

We deleted 17 tests today. It felt like clarity.

## The Problem

The test suite was passing but proving nothing. Tests checked implementation details - exact pixel arrangements in tray icons, specific data structures in memory, hardcoded values that never change.

They provided false confidence. "All tests pass" meant little when the tests measured the wrong things.

## The Question

"What would a user notice if this broke?"

That question eliminated most tests. Users don't see data structures. They don't count pixels in tray icons. They experience behavior: does the app start? Does right-click work? Does their folder become a website?

## What We Kept

Four tests that matter:
- **Tray icon appears** - User sees moss is running
- **Finder integration installs** - User can right-click folders  
- **Content transforms correctly** - User gets expected output
- **URLs parse properly** - User's folder paths work

These test the contract with humans, not the contract with code.

## What We Learned

**Test behavior, not implementation**. If you can refactor the code without changing tests, you're testing the right things. If refactoring breaks tests, you're probably testing implementation details.

**False confidence is dangerous**. Tests that always pass teach nothing. Tests that can fail meaningfully teach everything.

**Quality over quantity**. Four good tests are worth more than 17 tests that check nothing important.

The codebase is lighter. The tests are meaningful. Development moves faster because we're not maintaining tests that provide no value.

When in doubt, ask: "What would break the user experience?" Test that. Ignore the rest.
