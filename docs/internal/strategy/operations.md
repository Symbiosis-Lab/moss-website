## Operational Principles

### Spending Philosophy
- **Default alive** - Always maintain 6+ months runway
- **Revenue before hiring** - Don't hire based on grant promises
- **Frugal operations** - Every dollar must create user value

### Revenue Priorities
1. **Recurring revenue** (subscriptions) - Most predictable
2. **Service revenue** (support contracts) - Higher margins
3. **One-time revenue** (setup fees) - Good cash flow
4. **Grant revenue** (temporary boost) - Acceleration only

### Team Building Strategy
- Start solo, prove value first
- Add part-time technical help before full-time
- Hire for specific capabilities, not general growth
- Remote-first, but NYC-based for community building

## Risk Management

### Financial Risks
- Never hire based on grant promises alone
- Maintain minimum 6-month runway buffer
- Diversify revenue streams early

### Operational Risks  
- Keep technology stack simple and maintainable
- Avoid feature creep that complicates core value
- Build relationships before needing them

### Market Risks
- Stay close to user needs through regular feedback
- Don't over-invest in single user segment
- Maintain platform independence philosophy
